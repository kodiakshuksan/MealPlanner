## Project Description:
Search for recipe ideas by meal name and save your recipe links to a built-in weekly calender. Meal Planner also has a random cocktail button that will present you a cocktail recipe to go with your meal.

## Technologies Used:
MealDB API, CocktailDB API, HTML, CSS, Materialize, Javascript, Jquery, JSON, AJAX, Luxon Library

## User Story:

- On the main page the user will find an input bar to search for a meal and receive the recipe's information.

- There's a search button to the right which finds a random cocktail and receives the drink's information.

- To the left of the webpage there's a sidebar for the calendar modal, with a "open" button to view the weekly meal plan.

- On searching for a meal the user will be presented with a small display card that has a link for it's recipe/ingredients. As well as a link to a youtube video and a set of buttons to save this recipe's link to the calendar modal.

- On searching for a random drink the user will be presented with a small display card that has a it's information and link to the ingredients. As well as a set of buttons to save this drink's link to the calender modal.

- Upon opening the calender modal the user will find their selected meal and drink placed in the relevant week day. 

- The user can then scroll down to either "save & close" their choices within the calendar modal or "clear" the week days to select different meals and drinks. 

- This web application will hopefully help the user plan ahead, provide experience with new recipes and/or drinks, while assisting them with organizing it all for the upcoming week.

## Challenges:
- Finding a suitable API to match our desired functionality was our first major challenge. 

- It was also difficult to include and display the recipes within a card correctly and then saving them in the calendar modal as a link. 

- Then adding a button to clear the calendar and start new for the next week of meal planning and drinks.
