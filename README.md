# Group Project 1 - Room 4:

## Project Title: Meal-Planner

## Project Description: 
Search for your recipes by ingredient and save links to a built-in weekly calender. If you don't have any special ingredients you want to use, you can push the random recipe button for a list of 10 random recipes to choose from.

## APIs Used:
- TheMealDB to pull a random selection of recipes
- RecipePuppy to search recipes by ingredient

## User Story: 
AS A hungry person
I WANT an application to help find recipes, 
SO THAT I can readily plan a meal schedule, and start an appropriate shopping list.

## Acceptance Criteria: 

GIVEN a search bar with food inputs
WHEN I search for a recipe by ingredients,
THEN I am presented with a list of different recipes that meet my request.
WHEN I have a list of recipes,
THEN I can add these recipes links to the included calender. 
WHEN I have recipes on my schedule,
THEN I can write items to a shopping list that I can access later until I clear it. 

## Future Feature

- Can't decide what you want to cook or don't feel like cooking? Hook up Zomato API to search for local restaurants by cuisine.
- Add allergies, health restrictions
- Shopping list with price estimate and availability
- We are currently just displaying links to the recipes as search results, but we could display the title and link as a collapsed card and actually render the ingredients and instructions if the card is expanded
